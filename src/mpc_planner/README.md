## Features
This is a planner implementation for mobile robots navigating in 2D dynamic environments. It is designed to be:

- **Modular** - Cost and constraint components are modular to allow stacking of functionality.
- **Robot Agnostic** - The robot functionality in ROS wraps the base `C++` planner. This allows customization of the control loop, input and output topics and visualization.
- **ROS/ROS2 Compatible:** - ROS functionality is wrapped in `ros_tools` to support both ROS and ROS2.
- **Computationally Efficient:** - Typical real-time control frequencies with dynamic and static obstacle avoidance are ~20-30 Hz

To solve the MPC, we support the licensed [**Forces Pro**](https://www.embotech.com/softwareproducts/forcespro/overview/) and open-source [**Acados**](https://docs.acados.org/) solvers. The solvers can be switched with a single setting when both are installed. The solver generation is implemented in `Python`, generating `C++` code for the online planner.

Implemented MPC **modules** include:

- **Reference Path Tracking Cost** - Tracking a 2D path
  - Model Predictive Contouring Control ([MPCC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8768044))
  - Curvature-Aware Model Predictive Control ([CA-MPC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10161177))
- **Goal Tracking Cost** - Tracking a user defined goal position
- **State/Input Penalization** - To limit control inputs and track references
- **Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance Constraints** - Avoiding humans
  - Ellipsoidal constraints (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8768044)
  - Linearized constraints
- **Chance Constrained Obstacle Avoidance Constraints** - Incorporating uncertainty in the future motion of humans
  - Avoiding obstacle predictions modeled as Gaussians ([CC-MPC](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8613928))
  - Avoiding obstacle predictions modeled as Gaussian Mixtures ([Safe Horizon MPC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01070))
- **Static Obstacle Avoidance Constraints** - Avoiding non-moving obstacles in the environment
  - Using `decomp_util` (see [original paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7839930) and [modified implementation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11506))

These functionalities can be stacked to implement the desired behavior (see [Configuration](#configuration)). 

The [**Topology-Driven MPC**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06021) [1] module parallelizes the above functionality over multiple distinct initial guesses, computing several trajectories that pass the obstacles differently.

For more implementation details on [**SH-MPC**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01070) [2], see https://github.com/oscardegroot/scenario_module.

## Installation

We recommend to use the complete VSCode containerized environment provided here https://github.com/tud-amr/mpc_planner_ws, if you can, to automatically install the planner and its requirements.

> **Note:** While we support `Forces Pro` and `Acados`, we used `Forces Pro` for the results in our paper.

> **Note:** To use Forces Pro in the containerized environment, a floating license is required. If you have a regular license, please following the steps below to install the planner manually.

The following steps denote the **manual** installation of the planner.

---

### Step 1: Clone repos

In your `ROS`/`ROS2` workspace `ws/src`, clone the following:

Planner repos:
```
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/mpc_planner.git
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/ros_tools.git
```

Guidance planner (for T-MPC) and `decomp_util` (for static obstacle avoidance):
```
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/guidance_planner.git
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/DecompUtil.git
```

Pedestrian simulator:
```
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/pedestrian_simulator.git
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/pedsim_original.git
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/asr_rapidxml.git
```

Other simulator packages:
```
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/roadmap.git
git clone https://github.com/oscardegroot/jackal_simulator.git
```

### Step 2: Set your ROS version

From `ws/src` and with your ROS version either `1` or `2`:
```bash
cd mpc_planner
python3 switch_to_ros.py 1
cd ..

cd ros_tools
python3 switch_to_ros.py 1
cd ..

cd guidance_planner
python3 switch_to_ros.py 1
cd ..

cd pedestrian_simulator
python3 switch_to_ros.py 1
cd ..
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies

From `ws`:

```bash
rosdep install -y -r --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro noetic
```

### Step 4: Install your solver

The solver generation uses `Python3`. Requirements for the python environment are in `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml`. For Forces Pro, `Python 3.8` is required. You can set-up the environment yourself if you are familiar with virtual environments. Otherwise, explicit instructions are provided below.

We recomment to either use `poetry` or `conda`. 

**Conda**

If you have [`miniconda`](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/) installed you can use:

From `ws/src/mpc_planner`:
```bash
conda create -n mpc_planner --file requirements.txt
conda activate mpc_planner
```

You may have to add the `conda-forge` channel if you do not have it yet: `conda config --append channels conda-forge`.

> **Note:** In the remainder of this readme, leave out `poetry run ...` if you installed with `conda`.

Instead of `conda`, another option is to use `pyenv` and `poetry`.
<details>
    <summary><b  style="display:inline-block">Pyenv</b></summary>

To install `pyenv` (see https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation), first install system dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update; sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \
libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev curl \
libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev
```

Then get `pyenv`

```
curl https://pyenv.run | bash
```

And modify your shell, e.g., `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
[[ -d $PYENV_ROOT/bin ]] && export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
eval "$(pyenv init -)"
```
</details>
<details>
    <summary><b  style="display:inline-block">Poetry</b></summary>

Install `Python 3.8.10` and activate it:

```bash
pyenv install 3.8.10
pyenv local 3.8.10
# pyenv global 3.8.10 # required in some cases
```

To setup the Poetry environment run:

```bash
pip3 install poetry
poetry install --no-root
```
</details>

---

With the environment set up, install `Acados` and/or `Forces Pro`.
<details><summary><b  style="display:inline-block"> Solver: Acados</b></summary>
In any folder, clone and build Acados:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acados/acados.git
cd acados
git submodule update --recursive --init
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake -DACADOS_SILENT=ON ..
make install -j4
```

Then link `Acados` in your `Poetry` environment

```bash
poetry add -e <path_to_acados>/interfaces/acados_template # Poetry
```
or
```bash
pip install -e <path_to_acados>/interfaces/acados_template # Conda
```

And add the acados path in your `~/.bashrc` or similar:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<path_to_acados>/lib"
export ACADOS_SOURCE_DIR="<path_to_acados>"
```

</details>

<details>
    <summary><b  style="display:inline-block">Solver: Forces Pro</b></summary>

Go to [my.embotech.com](my.embotech.com), log in to your account. Assign a regular license to your computer. Download the client to `~/forces_pro_client/` **outside of the container**. If you have the solver in a different location, add its path to `PYTHONPATH`.
</details>

---

Finally, to generate a solver, first define which solver to use in `mpc_planner_<your_system>/config/settings.yaml` by setting `solver_settings/solver` to  `acados` or `forces`. Then generate a solver (e.g., for `jackalsimulator`):

```bash
poetry run python mpc_planner_jackalsimulator/scripts/generate_jackalsimulator_solver.py
```

You should see output indicating that the solver is being generated.


### Step 5: Build the planner
Source your ROS distribution (e.g., `source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`). Then build with:

```bash
catkin config --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release # Release, Debug, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel
catkin build mpc_planner_<your_system>
```

## Usage
Each system type has its own package (`mpc_planner_<system>`) that usually includes 

- a main file (`src/mpc_planner_<system>`),
- configuration (`config/settings.yaml`),
- launch file (e.g., `launch/ros1_<system>.launch`), and 
- solver definition script (`scripts/generate_<system>_solver.py`). 

To launch the planner for your system run its launch file, e.g.,

```bash
roslaunch mpc_planner_jackalsimulator ros1_jackalsimulator.launch
```

> **Note:** For some systems, detailed instructions are available in the `README.md` inside their packages.

## Configuration
The MPC problem is configured in the solver definition script (e.g., `mpc_planner_<system>/scripts/generate_<system>_solver.py`). The following defines a T-MPC that follows a reference path while avoiding dynamic obstacles.

```python
settings = load_settings() # Load config/settings.yaml

modules = ModuleManager()
model = ContouringSecondOrderUnicycleModel() # Define the dynamic model

base_module = modules.add_module(MPCBaseModule(settings))
base_module.weigh_variable(var_name="a", weight_names="acceleration") # Quadratic cost on input acceleration
base_module.weigh_variable(var_name="w", weight_names="angular_velocity") # Quadratic cost on angular velocity
base_module.weigh_variable(var_name="v",
                          weight_names=["velocity", "reference_velocity"], 
                          cost_function=lambda x, w: w[0] * (x-w[1])**2) # Track a reference velocity

modules.add_module(ContouringModule(settings)) # MPCC cost

modules.add_module(GuidanceConstraintModule(settings, constraint_submodule=EllipsoidConstraintModule)) # T-MPC with ellipsoidal constraints

generate_solver(modules, model, settings) # Generate the solver

```

Settings of the online solver can be modified in `config/settings.yaml`. Important settings are:

- `N` - Steps in the planner horizon
- `integrator_step` - Time between planner steps
- `n_discs` - Number of discs that model the robot area
- `solver_settings/solver` - Solver to use
- `debug_output` - Print debug information when enabled
- `control_frequency` - Planner control frequency
- `max_obstacles` - Maximum number of *dynamic* obstacles to avoid in the MPC
- `robot/` - The robot area (`com_to_back` is the distance from the center of mass to the back of the robot)
- `t-mpc/use_t-mpc++` - Enable T-MPC++, adding the non guided planner in parallel
- `weights/` - Default weights of the MPC. Can be modified online in `rqt_reconfigure`.

## Examples

### Custom System
Please see the `mpc_planner_jackalsimulator` package for an example of how to customize this planner. Explicit comments are provided throughout this package. See:

- [C++ Main File](mpc_planner_jackalsimulator/src/ros1_jackalsimulator.cpp) - Defining the input/output topics and control loop
- [Python Solver Generation File](mpc_planner_jackalsimulator/scripts/generate_jackalsimulator_solver.py) - Defining the MPC problem
- [Parameters](mpc_planner_jackalsimulator/config/settings.yaml) - Configuring the planner
- [Launch File](mpc_planner_jackalsimulator/launch/ros1_jackalsimulator.launch) - Launching the planner on the right topics

Launching this package simulates the Jackal robot in an environment with pedestrians.

### Custom Modules

To implement your own module, you need to define how it is handled in the solver in `Python` and what it computes online in `C++`. 

For a `Python` cost and constraint example, see [goal_module.py](mpc_planner_modules/scripts/goal_module.py) and [ellipsoid_constraints.py](mpc_planner_modules/scripts/ellipsoid_constraints.py).

For a `C++` cost and constraint example see [goal_module.cpp](mpc_planner_modules/src/goal_module.cpp) and [ellipsoid_constraints.py](mpc_planner_modules/src/ellipsoid_constraints.cpp).

As an example, by replacing the contouring cost with the goal module, the robot navigates to the user clicked goal instead of following a reference path.
